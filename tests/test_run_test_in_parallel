# by default pytest run the test in sequential order, 
# in real scenario a test suite will have a number of test files each file will have a bunch of tests.
# this will lead to a large execution time.
# to over come this, pytest provides us with an option to run tests in parallel.

# for this need to first install the pytest-xdist plugin.
# run the test: pytest -n <num> run the tests by using multiple workers, like pytest -n 3 here is 3

# we use test_multiplication.py and generate the xml by running


# pytest test_multiplication.py -v --junitxml="result.xml"
